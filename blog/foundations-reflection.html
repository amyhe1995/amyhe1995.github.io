        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing I learned was that I try to integrate growth mindset
        into my learning journey. From core part, I have learnt brain
        neuroplasticity. It develops our brains and ability. Mindsets play a
        significant role in determining life's outcomes. I will try to view
        challenges as opportunities to overcome something difficult and grow as
        a result. The more difficult the challenge, the greater the opportunity
        for learning and growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is thinking like a programmer. This thinking develops my
        problem-solving skills. When I start code now, I will understand the
        problem first, plan my approach and use problem solving skills such as
        pseudocode, reading error messages, console.logging and Googling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third is trying to help others. We are the learner, and the learner
        also is the teacher. When I help other people to deal with technical
        problems, I also learnt some new. When you can teach other people, it
        means you full understand these concept. In addition, pair programming
        is helpful. I can get new ideas from peer.
      </p>

      <p class="p-blod">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel that personal values encompasses all parts of my learning. The
        values have great influence on my motivation and my goal. As I love
        coding, I can keep learning 8 hours everyday. Empathy allows me to try
        my best to help others. Self-awareness plays an importance role in my
        learning journey. I will reflect my study everyday and I will look back
        the failure I made every week. I can constantly strive to improve on the
        things that I see as deficient at that stage and learn from my mistakes.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm surprised that Devacademy has put so much thought into actually
        teaching this aspect of human values and behavior in the course. The
        contents are both interesting, relevant and frankly quite fun to
        navigate through. I understand that these core concepts are useful in
        all job types, but to invest so much time in also teaching this has
        outlined what I can expect from myself at the end of my learning journey
        here.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </p>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspect for me was listening and looping. I try my
        best to listen other people, it hard for me to loop back what I heard in
        details.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that Devacademy is taking the time to focus on human skills
        because these skills can help us to understand our values and motivation
        and prepare us enter workplace. Being taught to be aware of the core
        skills early on will make it easy for transition from training to work
        and make us more desirable as a potential candidate.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not think like that. The core part is interesting and relavent. I
        have learned a lot more about myself and it makes my study plan clearly.
        This is most effective way for me to engage the study. These concepts
        change my thinking and my mindset.
