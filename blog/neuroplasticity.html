      <p class="p-blod">Describe how neuroplasticity is relevant to learning</p>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result
        of experience. Plasticity refers to the brain's malleability, which is
        defined as being easily influenced, trained, or controlled. Neuro refers
        to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain
        and nervous system. Thus, neuroplasticity is when nerve cells change or
        adjust.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many benefits of brain neuroplasticity. Allowing your brain to
        adapt and change helps promote:
        <ol>
          <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
          <li> The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities</li>
          <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
          <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined</li>
          <li>Improvements that can boost brain fitness</li>
        </ol>
          
      </p>
      <p>
      There are a lot of ways which you can take to improve neuroplasticity. Learning environments that offer plenty of opportunities for focused attention, novelty, and challenge have been shown to stimulate positive changes in the brain. Stimulating your brain might mean: learning a new language, learning how to play an instrument, traveling and exploring new places, creating art and other creative pursuits and reading. Get plenty of rest and exercise regularly also benefit our brain.

         Describe what Growth Mindset is and why it is important
      </p>
      <p>
      People with growth mindsets believe that skill and intelligence are something that people can develop. They believe that while people have inherent qualities and traits, success comes from constant personal development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research shows that mindsets play a significant role in determining life's outcomes. By understanding, adapting and shifting your mindset, you can improve your health, decrease your stress and become more resilient to life's challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey. I will try to view challenges as opportunities to overcome something difficult and grow as a result. The more difficult the challenge, the greater the opportunity for learning and growth. In the meanwhile, I will reflect each day on what I have failed at. I will focus on rewarding actions, not traits.
