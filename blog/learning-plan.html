      <p class="p-blod">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <p>
        My long term goal as I want to work as a full stack developer in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </p>
      <p>
        I think my strengths are good time management, working hard and focus
        expert. When I begin to study in EDA, I have made a plan for myself. So
        I usually followed my timetable to finish my tasks every day. In
        addition, I think I am hard working. As I am familiar with basic
        knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I prefer to spend around 50 hours
        a week studying.
      </p>
      <p>
        My limitation is second language study. As English is my second
        language, I have to spend more time understanding what I learn every
        day. sometimes I have to search online to find some source to help me
        understand some concept.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p>
        At Dev Academy, I want to improve my team working and communication
        skills. As English is my second language, I am not confident about
        myself. So I am afraid of talking with others.
      </p>

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives. What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you?
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer to create a to-do list in the morning, and I will rank my tasks
        based on their urgency and importance. And it is very common to have
        changes come up throughout my workday, I try to limit the number of
        daily tasks and save time if I need to make adjustments for any changes
        to my daily workload.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I have to work with other learners to finish the project, I will
        discuss the workload with him first and we need to divide the workload
        into small tasks for each people. In addition, if we meet some problems
        we cannot solve, we will ask for help from Facilitators.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </p>
      <p>
        As a developer, I think I will Google first as most coding issue you can
        find solution on the website. If this issues quite are difficult, I will
        seek help from cohort and facilitators.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to gain some feedback and suggestions from facilitation team. It
        is very immanent to describe my weaknesses and strengths by myself. I
        want to get objective feedback from facilitation team to improve myself.
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </p>
      <p>
        As two young kids' mum, anything unexpected will come up and affect my
        plan. In order to not bother with my study plan, I try to study go ahead
        and leave some time space for myself if my kids were illness. I also
        keep studying on the weekend if I cannot finish sprint tasks before
        Saturday.
