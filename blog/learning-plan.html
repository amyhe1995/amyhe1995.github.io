      <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
      <p>
        My long term goal as I want to work like full stack developer in the
        future.
      </p>
      <h1>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think my strengths are good time management, work hard and focus
        expert. When I begin to study on EDA, I have made an plan for myself. So
        I usually followed my timetable to finish my tasks everyday. In
        addition, I think I am hard working. As I am familiar with basic
        knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I prefer to spend around 50
        hours a week to study. My limitations are second language study. As
        English is my second language, I have to spend more time to understand
        what I learn everyday. sometime I have to search online to find some
        source to help me understand some concept.

      <h1>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h1>
      <p>
        At Dev Academy, I want to improve my team working and communication
        skills. As English is my second language, I am not confident about
        myself. So I am afraid of talking with other.

      <h1>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives. What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </h1>
      <p>
        I prefer to create a to-do list in the morning, and I will rank my tasks
        based on their urgency and importance. And it is very common to have
        changes come up throughout my workday, I try to limit the number of
        daily tasks and save time in the event that I need to make adjustments
        for any changes to my daily workload. If I have to work with other
        learners to finish the project, I will discuss workload with him first
        and we need to divide the workload into small tasks for each people. In
        addition, if we meet some problems we cannot solve, we will ask help
        from Facilitators.
      </p>
      <h1>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h1>
      <p>
        As a developer, I think I will Google first as most coding issue you can
        find solution on the website. If this issues quite are difficult, I will
        seek help from cohort and facilitators.
      </p>
      <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
      <p>
        I want to gain some feedback and suggestions from facilitation team.
        Actually, it is very immanent to describe my weaknesses and strengths by
        myself. I want to get objective feedback from facilitation team to
        improve myself.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h1>
      <p>
        As a two young kids of mum, anything unexpected will come up and affect
        my plan. In order to not bothering my study plan, I try to study go
        ahead and leave some time space for myself if my kids were illness. I
        also keep studying on weekend if I cannot finish sprint tasks before
        Saturday.
