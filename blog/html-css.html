      <h1>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h1>
      <p>
        display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes
        that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the
        containing element. It makes layouts that were previously accomplished
        with floats easier to create. No need to clear floats anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display:
        inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings
        are respected, but with display: inline they are not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display:
        inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element
        can sit next to other elements.
