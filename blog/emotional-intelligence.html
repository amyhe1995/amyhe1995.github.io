      <h1>EQ vs IQ</h1>

      <p class="p-blod">Describe the difference between EQ and IQ.</p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (EQ) is defined as the ability to perceive,
        control, and evaluate emotions. IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is
        a measure of a person’s reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to
        gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions
        or make predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the most
        common elements of your IQ include your ability to:
        <li>use logic to solve problems</li>
        <li>plan and strategize</li>
        <li>understand abstract ideas</li>
        <li>learn and adapt to change</li>
        <li>grasp and use language</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to your ability to sense
        emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how you use
        that awareness to guide your behavior. In general, if you have a high
        EQ, you may find it easier to:
        <li>identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
        <li>empathize with other people</li>
        <li>adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations</li>
        <li>control your impulses</li>
        <li>withstand temptations and delay gratification</li>
        <li>resolve conflicts with others</li>
        <li>communicate effectively</li>
      </p>
      <p class="p-blod">Describe why EQ is important.</p>
      <p>
        Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn’t enough on
        its own to achieve success in life. Your IQ can help you get into
        college, but it’s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and
        emotions when facing your final exams. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are
        most effective when they build off one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence affects your performance at school or work. High
        emotional intelligence can help you navigate the social complexities of
        the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career. In
        fact, when it comes to gauging important job candidates, many companies
        now rate emotional intelligence as important as technical ability and
        employ EQ testing before hiring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence affects your physical health. If you’re unable to
        manage your emotions, you are probably not managing your stress either.
        This can lead to serious health problems. Uncontrolled stress raises
        blood pressure, suppresses the immune system, increases the risk of
        heart attacks and strokes, contributes to infertility, and speeds up the
        aging process. The first step to improving emotional intelligence is to
        learn how to manage stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence affects your mental health. Uncontrolled emotions
        and stress can also impact your mental health, making you vulnerable to
        anxiety and depression. If you are unable to understand, get comfortable
        with, or manage your emotions, you’ll also struggle to form strong
        relationships. This in turn can leave you feeling lonely and isolated
        and further exacerbate any mental health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence affects your relationships. By understanding your
        emotions and how to control them, you’re better able to express how you
        feel and understand how others are feeling. This allows you to
        communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships, both at
        work and in your personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence affects your social intelligence. Being in tune
        with your emotions serves a social purpose, connecting you to other
        people and the world around you. Social intelligence enables you to
        recognize friend from foe, measure another person’s interest in you,
        reduce stress, balance your nervous system through social communication,
        and feel loved and happy.
