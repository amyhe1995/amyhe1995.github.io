      <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
      <p class="p-blod">
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The house example can be used to describe the relationship between HTML,
        CSS and JavaScript. A house has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and 2 stories.
        That is the HTML of the building. It is made of brick and has a solid
        wood door. That corresponds to the CSS of the building. JavaScript is
        the things that you interact with in your home. You can eat, sleep, make
        meals and anything that you do at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is the structure of the page itself. A CSS file contains the
        styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and
        more. JavaScript determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the
        page. It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within
        certain elements. This is kind of like the functionality of the
        building.

        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/train.webp" alt="train" class="float-right" />
      <p>
        Control flow likes a daily plan made by yourself. It is used to guide
        you on how to perform one day. On your daily plan list, it shows like 8
        am get up, 9 am breakfast, and 10 am working.....In the computer,
        control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a
        script. When you look at the train map, You also will find train works
        based on control flow. train stops are in order and the train should
        stop at each station based on the train map.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a
        condition. In our life, we use loops many times. For example, the public
        transport is from the first station to the end station. And then back
        from the first station to the end station. It works until the driver
        needs a break or finishes the job.

        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/DOM.png" alt="DOM" class="inline" />
      <p>
        DOM means Document Object Model and it defines the logical structure of
        documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. It is a
        programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove HTML
        elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to
        make our page more dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
        As seen in the diagram, DOM looks like a tree and HTML elements and
        attributes are the branches. JavaScript is used to manipulate these HTML
        elements or attributes based on DOM. In order to manipulate DOM,
        JavaScript functions are used and we should create an event to callback
        these functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to interact with DOM, the simple way is to open dev tools by
        right-clicking the mouse or trackpad and navigating down to "inspect".
        You will find the window like the picture below. Just click the element,
        and change something you want. these changes are not permanent. They
        will revert to what they were when the page is refreshed!

        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object are mutable data structure in javascript and it contains many
        values. It uses properties to store the data in key-value pair and the
        key can be anything except undefined. The keys are iterable and can be
        accessed in any order.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to access the object properties: dot notation and
        bracket notation. You can look at the picture below, the two ways can
        get some value from the person object.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/object.png" alt="object" class="code-pic" />
      <p>
        Arrays are a special type of object. Array is almost the same as object.
        It also contains many values. It also has keys and values. The main
        difference is that the key of array starts from 0 and The keys are in
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        For array, we can only use bracket notation to access the value as array
        stores the ordered data. You can only access the value based on the
        index. You can look at the picture below, the person[0] means the first
        element of the array. So the result is the name.
      </p>

      <p class="p-blod">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</p>
      <p>
        A function is like a math equation but with code, it is "self contained"
        modules of code that are designed to perform a specific task. Functions
        usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a
        function is defined, it can be used many times by changing input
        variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions are helpful. Once a function is defined, it can be used many
        times by changing input variables. It makes our code a lot less
        redundant. When you look at the add function, you can find the add
        function can be used many times by changing two parameter values.
