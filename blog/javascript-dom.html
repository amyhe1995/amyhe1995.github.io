      <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
      <p class="p-blod">
        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML likes the structure of house and CSS is the styles of house. The
        JavaScript is the function in this house like turn off or on the light.
      </p>

        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/train.webp" alt="train" class="float-right" />
      <p>
        Control flow likes daily plan which made by yourself. It is used to
        guide you how to performance one day. On you daily plan list, it shows
        like 8am get up, 9am breakfast, 10am working.....In the computer,
        control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a
        script. When you look at train map, You also will find train works based
        on control flow. train stops are in order and train should stop in each
        station based on train map.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a
        condition. In our life, we use loops many times. For example, the public
        transport is from the first station to end station. And then back to
        from first station to end station. It works until the driver need a
        break or finish the job.

        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/DOM.png" alt="DOM" class="inline" />
      <p>
        DOM means Document Object Model and it defines the logical structure of
        documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. It is a
        programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove HTML
        elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to
        make our page more dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
        As seen in the diagram, DOM looks like a tree and HTML elements and
        attributes are the branches. JavaScript is used to manipulate these HTML
        elements or attributes based on DOM. In order to manipulate DOM,
        JavaScript functions is used and we should create a event to callback
        these functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to interact with DOM, the simple way is to open devTools by
        right clicking the mouse or trackpad and navigating down to "inspect".
        You will find the window like the picture below. Just click element, and
        change something you want. these changes are not permanent. They will
        revert back to what they were when the page is refreshed!

        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object are mutable data structure in javascript and it contains many
        values. It use properties to store the data in key value pair and the
        key can be anything except for undefined. The keys are iterable and can
        be accessed in any order.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to access the object properties: dot notation and
        bracket notation. You can look the picture below, the two ways can get
        some value from the person object.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/object.png" alt="object" class="code-pic" />
      <p>
        Arrays are a special type of objects. Array is most same like object. It
        also contains many value. It also has key and values. The main
        difference is that the key of array starts from 0 and The keys are in
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        For array, we can only use bracket notation to access the value as array
        stores the ordered data. You can only access the value based on the
        index. You can look the picture below, the person[0] means the first
        element of array. So the result is name.
