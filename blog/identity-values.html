      <h2>
        Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values. *
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
        Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
        decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Making good ethical decisions requires a trained sensitivity to ethical
        issues and a practiced method for exploring the ethical aspects of a
        decision and weighing the considerations that should impact our choice
        of a course of action. It is essential for us to study how to make
        ethical decision. I also met a situation where I have to deal with this
        ethical problem. When I worked as a checkout staff in a retail store, I
        witnessed a staff taking cash from the till. At first, it looked just
        like changing over the till, but I decided to confront the staff anyway.
        The staff was actually taking money from the till, and I took the cash
        she had from the till, and placed it back in the till and notified it to
        manager. We were able to resolve the issue through balancing the cash
        drawer and ensuring that particular employee was unable to commit theft
        from the company again.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A number of cultural aspects influence the way we interact with other
        people, including national culture, gender culture, corporate culture
        and various communication styles. As a chinese, the national culture
        affect me a lot. My culture affect me how I solve challenges and
        conflicts and how I conduct work. It also has influence on my behavior.
        The core value of chinese identity like harmony, benevolence, loyalty
        and hardworking. Harmony encompasses rationale, propriety, and
        compatibility. I usually try properly coordinate different things by
        bringing them together in the appropriate manner. In the meanwhile, I
        always considered my family, friendships and social relationship based
        on benevolence. In addition, I think I am loyalty as I am faithful to
        family, friends, company and society. I am hardworking person like my
        parents to to create a better life for family.

      <h2>
        Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations. *
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
        career development
      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths are good time management, take responsibility for my
        underlying goal and focus expert. I prefer to plan everything and set
        timelines and deadlines for my plans. In addition, my strong ethical
        principles donâ€™t allow me to simply write off missteps with excuses and
        rationalizations. My limitation is hard say no for people whenever
        people ask me for help, I always say yes without assessing my workload
        and my schedule. However, I am aware of my weakness. I am mindful of it
        and try to improve it in the future.
      </p>
      <h2>
        * Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning
        journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think all both my strengths which help me in my learning journey. As I
        am focus learner, I usually pick up new technologies quickly and focus
        on it. In addition, I have good time management. I prefer to make daily
        study plan and follow my timelines to finish tasks.
      </p>
      <h2>
        * Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
        productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
        the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
        reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was working as a design specialist in my team, and one new colleague
        was constantly late finishing tasks. As Christmas is coming, our store
        is super busy. I told the staff to work quickly and teach her how to
        arrange time properly. Maybe my attitude is not properly and the staff
        felt angry although she followed my suggestions and then finished tasks
        on time. I think I am not her supervisor so she is not happy to follow
        my instructions. Now, if I back to this situation again, I will try
        myself calmed down and will asked her that should I help her rather than
        tell her some instructions to improve her speed. I think this strategy
        is easily accepted by colleague.
